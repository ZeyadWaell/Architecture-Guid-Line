ðŸ“Œ .NET Software Architectures Guide
ðŸš€ Software architectures in .NET define how code is structured to promote maintainability, testability, and scalability. This guide covers five widely used architectures:

âœ… Clean Architecture â€“ Domain-centric with independent layers.
âœ… Onion Architecture â€“ Layered with dependencies pointing inward.
âœ… Hexagonal Architecture â€“ Isolates core logic via ports and adapters.
âœ… Layered Architecture â€“ Traditional stacked layers.
âœ… Three-Tier Architecture â€“ Physically separates UI, logic, and data.
