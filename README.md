📌 .NET Software Architectures Guide
🚀 Software architectures in .NET define how code is structured to promote maintainability, testability, and scalability. This guide covers five widely used architectures:

✅ Clean Architecture – Domain-centric with independent layers.
✅ Onion Architecture – Layered with dependencies pointing inward.
✅ Hexagonal Architecture – Isolates core logic via ports and adapters.
✅ Layered Architecture – Traditional stacked layers.
✅ Three-Tier Architecture – Physically separates UI, logic, and data.

Each architecture integrates key components like Unit of Work, Generic Repository, Services, External Services, Specification, and CQRS to enhance functionality and maintainability.

🛠️ Architectures
1️⃣ Clean Architecture
📌 Overview:
Clean Architecture focuses on domain-driven design (DDD), where the core business logic is isolated from external systems. It follows dependency inversion to ensure high testability and maintainability.

🔹 Key Principles:

Separates concerns into domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers.
Uses interfaces and dependency injection to decouple business logic.
Implements CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for better separation of concerns.

2️⃣ Onion Architecture
📌 Overview:
Onion Architecture enforces a strict separation of concerns by structuring dependencies so that inner layers do not depend on outer layers.

🔹 Core Features:

Inward dependency flow (outer layers depend on inner layers).
Promotes loose coupling and testability.
Uses domain models as the core of the application.
📁 Layered Structure:

3️⃣ Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
📌 Overview:
Also called Ports and Adapters Architecture, this approach isolates core business logic from external dependencies like databases, APIs, or UIs.

🔹 Key Concepts:

Uses "Ports" (interfaces) and "Adapters" (implementations).
Facilitates easy replacement of infrastructure components.
Encourages high modularity and testability.

4️⃣ Layered Architecture
📌 Overview:
The traditional approach where the system is structured into Presentation, Business, and Data Layers.

🔹 Characteristics:

Common in enterprise applications.
Promotes separation of concerns.
Can lead to tight coupling if not implemented correctly.

5️⃣ Three-Tier Architecture
📌 Overview:
A variation of the Layered Architecture, but with a physical separation of tiers.

🔹 Components:

Presentation Tier – UI Layer (React, Angular, Blazor).
Business Logic Tier – Application logic (ASP.NET Core, Services).
Data Tier – Database (SQL Server, MongoDB).
